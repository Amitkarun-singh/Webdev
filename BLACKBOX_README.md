## README.md

This repository contains the code for a simple text adventure game. The game is written in Python and uses the [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) library.

To play the game, clone the repository and install the dependencies. Then, run the following command:

```
python main.py
```

The game will start and you will be prompted to enter your name. Once you have entered your name, you will be presented with a map of the game world. You can move around the map by using the arrow keys.

To interact with objects in the game, you can use the following commands:

* `look`: Look at an object.
* `talk`: Talk to an NPC.
* `take`: Take an object.
* `use`: Use an object.

The game is over when you have defeated the final boss.

## Step-by-step explanation of the code

The code for the game is divided into two files: `main.py` and `game.py`.

`main.py` is the main entry point for the game. It initializes the Pygame library and creates the game window. It also loads the game assets, such as the images and sounds.

`game.py` contains the code for the game logic. It defines the game world, the objects in the world, and the rules of the game. It also contains the code for the game loop, which runs until the game is over.

The game world is represented by a 2D grid. Each cell in the grid can contain an object, such as a wall, a floor, or a character. The player can move around the game world by using the arrow keys.

The objects in the game world can be interacted with by using the commands listed above. For example, the player can look at an object by using the `look` command. If the object is a character, the player can talk to them by using the `talk` command. If the object is a takeable item, the player can take it by using the `take` command. If the object is a usable item, the player can use it by using the `use` command.

The game loop runs until the player has defeated the final boss. The game loop consists of the following steps:

1. The player inputs are read.
2.
