// 01. Count the occurrences.

// You are building a word count generator that will take a large string of text as input and output the words and the number of times they are present in the string. Your task is to write a function that can count the occurrences of each word in the string and return a Map containing each word's count. For simplicity, you can assume that the string only contains alphabetic characters and spaces.

function countWords(str) {
    const words = str.split(" ");
    const map = new Map();

    for (let word of words) {
        if (map.has(word)) {
        map.set(word, map.get(word) + 1);
        } else {
        map.set(word, 1);
        }
    }

    return map;
}

const sentence = "I am xyz. I am learning web development from PW Skills.";
console.log(countWords(sentence));
