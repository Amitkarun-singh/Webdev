// 06. Nested Objects.

// Write a function that takes an object representing a person as input and extracts the name and street properties from a nested object using object destructuring. The function should return an object with these two properties. A sample object is given below.

const person = {
    name: "Mithun",
    age: 21,
    address: {
        street: "B8, Block B, Industrial Area.",
        city: "Sector 62, Noida",
        state: "Uttar Pradesh",
    },
};

function extractData(obj) {
    const {
        name,
        address: { street },
    } = obj;
    return { name, street };
}

console.log(extractData(person));
