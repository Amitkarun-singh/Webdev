<!-- 3. Color Mixer
Write a JavaScript program that takes in two strings representing colors and uses a switch statement to
determine the resulting color when the two colors are mixed. The program should print the resulting color
based on the following criteria"
. If color1 is "red" and color2 is "blue" or vice versa, print "purple".
. If color1 is "red" and color2 is "yellow" or vice versa, print "orange".
. If color1 is "blue" and `color2" is "yellow" or vice versa, print "green".
. If any other combination of colors is input, the program should print "Invalid color combination". -->
